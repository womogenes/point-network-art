# Point Network Art

Points move around on the screen and lines connect them if they're close enough!

The objective of this project is to create an easily-embeddable banner-type thing. Embed the url

`https://womogenes.github.io/point-network-art?title=<title>&fontSize=<fontSize>`

in an iframe, where `<title>` is the text to display and `<fontSize>` is a CSS-compatible string representing the font size, such as `12pt` or `5em` or `6vw`.

## Possible upcoming features

If I ever come back to this and decide I want better customization, here are some things I might add customization to:

- Different fonts from Google fonts
- Point density
- Point color

And here are a few general things:

- Weakening edges when their endpoints get near the edges of the screen
